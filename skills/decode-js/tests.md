# Test Suite Reference (`decoder/decode-js/test/`)

A small [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/) suite — **5 test files, 13 `test()` cases** at this
pin — split between one end-to-end plugin fixture and a handful of per-visitor fixtures.
Every case is fixture-driven: a `.js` input is transformed and its output compared to
either the input itself (no-op expected) or a `.fix.js` golden file.

## Config (`vitest.config.js`)

- **Path aliases** — `#plugin` → `src/plugin`, `#visitor` → `src/visitor`. Tests import
  the code under test through these (e.g. `#plugin/sojsonv7.js`, `#visitor/split-assignment`).
- **Coverage** — enabled by default (`@vitest/coverage-v8`), scoped to `src`, with
  `text` + `json` + `json-summary` reporters and `reportOnFailure: true`.
- `passWithNoTests: true`.

Run with `npm test` (`vitest --config vitest.config.js`) or `npx vitest run`.

## Harness (`test/helper.js`)

Two helpers, both reading fixtures relative to a passed-in base path and asserting with
Vitest's `expect(...).toBe(...)`:

- **`getVisitorResult(visitor, fix, input)`** — parses `<input>.js`, runs
  `traverse(ast, visitor)`, generates, and compares. When `fix` is **true** the output
  must equal `<input>.fix.js` (the visitor changed the code); when **false** it must equal
  the original source (the visitor must **no-op** — the "invalid"/negative cases). For
  `fix` cases, it additionally asserts `referenceState(ast)` (a sorted per-scope snapshot
  of each binding's `references`/`constant`/`constantViolations.length`) equals
  `referenceState(parse(cmpCode))` — a fresh parse of the golden output. This catches a
  missing or mis-scoped `scope.crawl()` (stale reference counts) even when the generated
  text already matches; added after a real bug of this kind in
  [split-assignment](visitors/split-assignment.md).
- **`getPluginResult(plugin, fix, input)`** — same contract but calls `plugin(source)`
  directly (full pipeline, not a single visitor).

So a fixture directory pairs `name.js` with an optional `name.fix.js`; the test's `fix`
flag encodes whether a transformation is expected.

## Directory breakdown

### `test/sojsonv7/` — end-to-end plugin test

`sojsonv7.test.js` → one case `sample_189`, run through `getPluginResult(PluginSojsonV7,
true, …)`. The input `sample_189.js` is a **~101 KB** real `jsjiami.com.v7` sample
(`var version_ = "jsjiami.com.v7"; …`) that decodes all the way down to the 8-byte golden
file `sample_189.fix.js` containing just `"width";` — a compact regression anchor for the
entire [sojsonv7](plugins/sojsonv7.md) pipeline (global decode + dead-code + purify +
env-unlock). It is the only full-plugin fixture in the suite.

### `test/visitor/` — per-visitor fixtures

| test file | visitor | cases (valid → `.fix.js`, invalid → no-op) |
|-----------|---------|--------------------------------------------|
| `split-assignment.test.js` | [split-assignment](visitors/split-assignment.md) | `call-valid-1`, `if-assignment-valid`, `if-member-valid`, `member-valid-1`, `variable-valid` (valid); `if-invalid`, `variable-invalid` (no-op) |
| `split-variable-declarator.test.js` | [split-variable-declarator](visitors/split-variable-declarator.md) | `init-valid-1` (valid); `parent-invalid`, `init-invalid` (no-op) |
| `parse-control-flow-storage.test.js` | [parse-control-flow-storage](visitors/parse-control-flow-storage.md) | `object-invalid-1` (no-op) |

Concrete examples of what the fixtures pin down:

- **split-assignment `call-valid-1`** — hoists assignments buried in a computed
  member/callee chain into ordered statements (`d = _; b = d[d("1")]("2"); x[…] = …`),
  exactly the [split-assignment](visitors/split-assignment.md) `getInsertPath` behavior.
- **split-variable-declarator `init-valid-1`** — `let a = (() => {}, function(){})` →
  `() => {}; let a = function(){}`. Note this visitor is otherwise
  [wired into no plugin](visitors/split-variable-declarator.md) — the test is its only
  caller.
- **parse-control-flow-storage `object-invalid-1`** — a one-property object whose function
  returns a `typeof … || … || …` logical chain (params length 1, not the accepted 2-arg
  shapes). It must be left untouched, exercising the "incomplete match ⇒ bail"
  [completeness gate](visitors/parse-control-flow-storage.md).

Coverage is uneven by design: `split-assignment`, `split-variable-declarator`, and
`parse-control-flow-storage` have dedicated fixtures, while most other visitors and
plugins are only exercised transitively through the `sample_189` end-to-end case.

## CI (`.github/workflows/test.yml`)

"Unit Tests" runs on push / PR to `main`: Node **26** with npm cache, `npm ci` with
`npm_config_build_from_source: true` (so `isolated-vm`'s native module builds reliably),
`npx vitest run` (with `always()` so a report posts even on failure), then
`davelosert/vitest-coverage-report-action` publishes the coverage summary as a PR comment.
